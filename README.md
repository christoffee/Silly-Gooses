Silly Goose and Moose
==================
My js13kgames 2014 entry by christoffee.

This game was inspire by the water element of the game theme of the js13kgames competition, but then I sort of lost my way trying to make the gooses sillier... Then I added the earth element by untroducing a moose and the game evolved into single person mulitplayer :/. Its a silly game.

##Objective
When you are the goose the pond will drain and you need to collect water to get points. But before the pond has fully drained you can switch to the moose by collecting the red switch element. When you are the moose the pond is overflowing and you collect dirt for points. Then when the pond is about to overflow you can switch back to the goose.

The more element you collect the more the water level will become harder to control. Collect as mauch earth and water before silly moose or goose lose their homes.

##How To Play
Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to navigate the goose/moose around the pond and hold SPACEBAR to collect an element.
