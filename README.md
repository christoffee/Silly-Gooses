Silly-Gooses
==================
My js13kgames 2014 entry and a christoffee game.

This game was inspire by the water element of the game theme of the js13kgames competition, but then I sort of lost my way trying to make the gooses sillier... I have a problem. 

##Objective
The mother goose's baby goose's have got loose and away from the safey of the pond. The baby gooses have failed to realise that the hungry fox is on the hunt for his lunch... silly gooses. Can you save all the mother goose's baby gooses without getting eaten by the fox? 

###Why 'Silly Gooses' its Geese you fool!
Maybe because I wanted a silly goose game and theres nothing silly about geese or to troll grammer nazis? I don't know.

###But why are the gooses silly?
You're silly!

##How To Play
Use the LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to navigate mother goose around the pond and SPACEBAR to launch a resue. 

Powers:
<ul>
<li>P = To pause time and space (Pause menu).</li>
<li>L = Laser beam vision for more accurate rescues.</li>
<li>S = Laser beam vision for more accurate rescues.</li>
</ul>
